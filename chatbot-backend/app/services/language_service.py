# This service previously handled language detection and translation.
# This functionality has been removed as per requirements.
# Other services should now handle language specification directly
# if needed for external API calls (e.g., summarization, voice synthesis).

# Placeholder or utility functions related to language *selection*
# could potentially reside here if needed in the future, but for now,
# the core detection/translation logic is removed.

# Currently, no functions are defined here after removal.
